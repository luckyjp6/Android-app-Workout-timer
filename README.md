# Workout Tool
I was looking for an app to track my workout, like counting reps for exercise A, or timing exercise B.  
But I couldn't find one in the app store that met my needs and was easy to use.  
So I wrote one by myself.

## Used tools
- Develop with Android Studio using Kotlin as the programming language.
- Use Room database to retain previously saved data even after closing the app or reinstalling a new version.
- The program architecture is based on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

## Future Plan
Please refer to issues.

## Version history
- v1.0: An app meets my initial requirements and works properly.
  - v1.0.1: Add pause button to the training screen in case that something urgent comes up.
  - v1.0.2: Fix the incorrect total time displayed on the menu list screen.
  - v1.0.3: Add a theme feature, including Light/Dark mode, with the color theme dynamically adapting to the user's wallpaper.
